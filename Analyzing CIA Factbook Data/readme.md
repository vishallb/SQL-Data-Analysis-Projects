# Analyzing CIA World Factbook Data Using SQL

This project is aimed at analyzing data from the CIA World Factbook database, which is a compendium of statistics about all countries worldwide. The Factbook provides intelligence on various aspects such as history, people, government, economy, energy, geography, environment, communications, transportation, military, terrorism, and transnational issues for 266 world entities.

In this project, we'll focus on demographic information like global population, annual population growth rate, and total land and water area. We'll be using SQL to extract insights from the database.
