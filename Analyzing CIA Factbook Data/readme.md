In this project, we'll be working with the **demographic information** like the following: <br>

**`population`** — the global population <br>
**`population_growth`** — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.<br>
**`area`** — the total land and water area.

We'll use SQL to analyze the data from this [database](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db).
