# Finding the Groove: Uncovering Business Insights of Chinook Music Store

## Introduction

In this project, we will be working with the Chinook database, which contains information about a fictional digital music store. The database includes data on artists, songs, albums, employees, customers, and purchases, and is composed of eleven tables. 

The main objectives of this project are to uncover business insights from the data in the Chinook database by answering the following questions:

1. Identify the top three albums from a new record label to add to the store.
2. Analyze the sales performance of sales support agents to identify the best performer.
3. Analyze sales by country to determine average sales and order value.
4. Determine if more revenue is generated from individual track purchases or album purchases.

## Data Source

The Chinook database can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to extract business insights from the Chinook database using SQL. We aim to provide actionable recommendations to improve the store's revenue and profitability. The questions we will be answering include:

1. Which albums from a new record label should be added to the store?
2. Who is the best sales support agent?
3. Which countries generate the most revenue for the store?
4. Should the store focus on individual track purchases or album purchases?

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented using SQL, a popular relational database language. We used SQLite to query the Chinook database and extract relevant information for our analysis.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the Chinook database, we were able to provide insights into the store's sales performance, revenue generated from different countries, and the effectiveness of sales support agents. Our recommendations can help the store make informed decisions to improve its profitability and customer satisfaction.
