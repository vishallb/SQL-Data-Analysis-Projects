# SQL Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that I have completed, ranging from basic SQL queries to more complex data analysis tasks.

## Technologies Used

- SQL: All of the projects in this repository are implemented using SQL, a domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases.
- SQLite: SQLite is a lightweight, open-source SQL database engine that is used to store and manage the data for the projects in this repository. It is a popular choice for small- to medium-sized applications due to its simplicity and low overhead.

## Data Sources

The data used in these projects is sourced from various places, including public datasets, simulated data, and personal data. Each project's README file will include details about where the data was sourced from and how it was processed.

## Project Goals

The goals of these projects vary, but generally involve using SQL to extract insights and answer questions about the data. Some of the projects may involve basic SQL queries, while others may involve more complex data analysis and manipulation tasks.

## Projects

Each project is contained in its own directory within this repository, with a README file that includes a description of the project and the data used. 

## Conclusion

This repository is a collection of my SQL projects, aimed at exploring and analyzing data using SQL queries. Each project is designed to help me improve my SQL skills and gain experience working with real-world data. I hope that this repository will be useful to others looking to learn more about SQL and data analysis.
